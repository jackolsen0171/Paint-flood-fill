# flood-fill

Microsoft paint but better.
Features a status bar displaying which mode the program is in.

The algorithm used for the recursive floodfill checks whether the current grid square is the colour of the clicked square or not. If it's not, fill the square and repeat for all neighbours.

Fill:

- choose a colour for fill
- click fill button
- click on a square to fill the area

pixel density can be changed in the settings at the ROW = COL = n
width and height can be resized = settings. buttons scale with size, I hope...

Enjoy!
