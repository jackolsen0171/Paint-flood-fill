# flood-fill
flood fill program where user can draw their own shapes....(in development)
shows a status bar displaying which mode the program is in.

colour change for the fill colour can be achieved in the settings file. I should probably update this where the user can change fill colour during runtime. I will if I have some spare time.
The algorithm used for the recursive floodfill checks whether the current grid square is the background colour or not. if its not, fill the square and repeat for all neighbours.
